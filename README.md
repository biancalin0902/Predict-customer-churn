# Predict-customer-churn
This analysis aims to predict customer churn by leveraging demographic and behavioral 
data. The dataset includes customer information such as age, nationality, and gender, along with 
banking activity details like membership status, credit card ownership, and the number of 
financial products used. The primary objective is to explore the factors influencing customer 
attrition, focusing on the Exited column, and to identify patterns that can guide predictive 
modeling.
